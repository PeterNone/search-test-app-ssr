			"description": "DC41 Mk2 has Dysons latest Radial Root Cyclone technology for superior dust collection, and Ball technology for smooth steering around your home. Tangle-free Turbine Tool Great for pet hair on stairs and upholstery The Tangle-free Turbine tool is the only turbine tool that doesnt tangle. Counter-rotating heads with brushes remove hair from carpets and upholstery, so theres no brush bar for hair to wrap around. The flexible heads bend to maintain contact across uneven surfaces, and theyre positioned so that the brushes reach to the front and sides of the tool drawing hair and dirt in from all directions. More hair is released straight into the bin than with any other mini turbine tool. Self-adjusting Cleaner Head The cleaner heads on most upright vacuums need to be manually adjusted for different floor types. If this isnt done, a gap is created between the cleaner head and the floor, and suction is lost. The latest Dyson upright vacuums have an active base plate that self-adjusts across every floor type. It maintains close contact with the floor at all times, automatically raising and lowering. Suction isnt wasted its sealed in. Radial Root Cyclone technology Conventional vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. But when you start to use some bagged machines, dust can clog the tiny holes in the bag. Some ordinary bag less vacuum cleaners work in a similar way. They use a central filter to trap fine dust, which can clog too. Suction drops, leaving dust and dirt behind in your home. Dysons patented cyclone technology captures more dirt than any other cyclone. In Radial Root Cyclone technology remodelled airflows maximise suction power. Improved flow efficiency reduces turbulence and preserves air pressure, so more microscopic particles are extracted by the inner cyclones. These refinements help remove more dust, allergens and pet hair from the home. Even more brush bar power over the MK1 The power draw of the motor-head motor has been incr",

			"description": "Air Multiplier technology:Dyson AM06 fans use Air Multiplier technology to create a powerful stream of uninterrupted airflow. Air is accelerated through an annular aperture, creating a high-velocity jet of air.This passes over an airfoil-shaped ramp, channelling its direction and creating areas of low pressure behind and around the fan. The change in pressure forces surrounding air to be drawn into the airflow, resulting in a powerful stream of smooth cooling air.Sound 75% quieter:By reducing turbulence within Dyson Cool fans, Dyson engineers were able to make them quieter. To do this, they streamlined the airflow paths within the machines, allowing air to pass through smoothly. They also designed a Helmholtz cavity for each fan, which captures and dissipates sound from the motor.40% less power consumed:Reducing turbulence makes the fans quieter, but it also means that less energy is required to move air through them. While the fans still produce powerful airflow, their motors are calibrated to run more slowly, drawing less energy.Sleep timer: Fan can be programmed to turn off after preset intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 9 hours.Remote control: With 10 precise airflow settings, sleep timer, on/off and oscillation control. Curved and magnetized to store neatly on the machine.Oscillation control: Airflow can be directed around a room - one touch for smooth oscillation.Easy tilt: Pivots on its own centre of gravity.Easy to clean: No awkward safety grilles or blades.Safe: No fast-spinning blades.Acoustic Engineering: Awarded by the Noise Abatement Society for improved sound quality.Dimensions:Total height 550 mm / Airflow at max Setting: 370L/S / Weight: 1.8kg / Amp Diameter: 250mm / Base diameter(with plate):147mm / Cord Length: 1.8m",

			"product_name": "Dyson AM06WH Desk Fan",
			"description": "The Dyson Cool AM06 Desk Fan generates smooth, powerful airflow for personal cooling. Like all Dyson bladeless fans, it uses Air Multiplier technology to draw in surrounding air, creating powerful air projection. Some fans are quiet but weak; others are powerful but noisy. The Dyson AM06 is both quiet and powerful. Dyson engineers have reduced turbulence and noise throughout the machine by channelling airflow more efficiently. Motor noise and vibration have been isolated and significantly reduced. AM06 now houses a Helmholtz cavity, designed to capture and dissipate noise from the motor which has been calibrated to run slower whilst maintaining powerful airflow. Theres also a remote control for precise airflow control, and a sleep timer AM06 can be programmed to turn off after preset intervals, for ease of use throughout the night. All Dyson machines are tested rigorously during development, so the AM06 comes with a 2 year parts and labour guarantee. Key features: Air Multiplier technology air is accelerated through an annular aperture, drawing in surrounding air to project smooth, powerful, high-velocity airflow. Safe no fast-spinning blades. Acoustic engineering streamlined air channels for reduced airflow turbulence. Awarded the Quiet Mark by the Noise Abatement Society. Energy efficient engineered to create powerful airflow using 30% less energy than AM01. Sleep timer AM06 can be programmed to turn off after preset intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 9 hours. Remote control 10 precise airflow settings. Curved and magnetised to store neatly on the machine. Oscillation control to project air around the room. One touch for smoother oscillation. Touch-tilt pivots on its own centre of gravity, staying put without clamping. Easy to clean no awkward grilles or blades.",

			"description": "Top features: - One Touch NFC technology lets you control your dryer with an app - Condenser drying with three sensor drying options - Heat pump technology is highly energy efficient - Practical features that help you get through your laundry One Touch The Hoover Dynamic Next DX H9A2DCEB NFC 9 kg Heat Pump Tumble Dryer uses NFC technology so you can use your Android smartphone to interact with your dryer. Using the Hoover Wizard app, you can control, monitor and manage the tumble dryer with ease. Condenser drying Condenser tumble dryers don't require an external wall vent to get rid of steam, so you have the freedom to place it anywhere. The water is instead collected in a container, which can be easily emptied out thanks to AquaVision technology. With sensor drying you can set the level of dryness you need from three options. Once the desired dryness has been achieved, the dryer will switch off so you don't over-dry your clothes or waste any energy. Heat pump technology Heat pump driers are highly energy efficient - heating the air using 'refrigerant' instead of electricity, which consumes much less power and ensures no energy is wasted. Practical features For added convenience, you can delay the start of the drying cycle for up to 24 hours to take advantage of cheaper-rate electricity tariffs. You can easily load and unload you laundry as the tumble dryer has an extra-large porthole. And because the dyer has a spacious 9 kg capacity, you can dry large loads with ease.",

The technology inside has not simply been shrunk, but concentrated every angle and dimension re-engineered for the ultimate cleaning power and performance. Four key cleaner head technologies combine to give DC50 Multi Floor Dysons most advanced cleaner head technology yet. It has been engineered for increased dirt pick-up across all floors. The cleaner head adjusts automatically to different floor types, and the brush bar contains carbon fibre filaments for removing fine dust from hard floors. Like all Dyson vacuums, the DC50 Multi Floor has no bag, so theres no loss of suction. Instead, patented cyclone technology spins dust and dirt from the air. With 2 Tier Radial cyclones, the DC50 Multi Floor has 19 cyclones that work in parallel across two tiers to generate high centrifugal forces. Microscopic particles as small as 0. 5 microns are captured from the airflow. With Dysons latest Ball technology, even more of the vacuums key components are located inside the ball itself. This reduces clutter on the outside of the machine, streamlining its profile. DC50 Multi Floor turns on the spot, steering easily around furniture and into difficult places.",

It can be used all year round with Air Multiplier technology heating up the whole room quickly and evenly with purified air, whist keeping your home cooler in the summer months. Cleaner Air The Dyson Pure Cool captures potentially toxic fumes and odours, sifting out 99. 95 per cent of harmful particles, such as formaldehyde from furniture, chemical substances from things like cleaners or candles. A 360 Glass HEPA filter captures ultrafine particles from the air, removing allergens and pollutants including pollen and bacteria.

It switches back on again automatically when required - this way your room never overheats and energy is not wasted. Perfect for night time use It is the only fan heater with Quiet Mark accreditation.

			"description": "Top features: - One Touch NFC technology lets you control your dryer with an app - Condenser drying with three sensor drying options - Heat pump technology is highly energy efficient - Practical features that help you get through your laundry One Touch The Hoover Dynamic Next DX H9A2DCE NFC 9 kg Heat Pump Tumble Dryer uses NFC technology so you can use your Android smartphone to interact with your dryer. Using the Hoover Wizard app, you can control, monitor, and manage the tumble dryer with ease. Condenser drying Condenser tumble dryers don't require an external wall vent to get rid of steam, so you have the freedom to place it anywhere. The water is instead collected in a container, which can be easily emptied out thanks to AquaVision technology. With sensor drying you can set the level of dryness you need from three options. Once the desired dryness has been achieved, the dryer will switch off so you don't over-dry your clothes or waste any energy. Heat pump technology Heat pump driers are highly energy efficient - heating the air utilising 'refrigerant' instead of electricity, which consumes much less power and ensures no energy is wasted. Practical features For added convenience, you can delay the start of the drying cycle for up to 24 hours to take advantage of cheaper-rate electricity tariffs. You can easily load and unload you laundry as the tumble dryer has an extra-large porthole. And because the dyer has a spacious 9 kg capacity, you can dry large loads with ease.",

			"description": "Details Bagless Cleaning This Dyson cylinder vacuum is a bagless model, so you will never have to buy or change a vacuum bag again. The CINBIGBALLAN2+s larger, high-capacity bin holds more dirt than the previous model, so you wont need to empty it so often. Unlike most bagless vacuums, this models bin emptying button doesnt just open a flap; it actually drives the dirt out of the bin. This means no more knocking and tapping the container to get the dust and debris out. Empty your bin easily, at the push of a button. Clever Technology This product uses Dysons Cinetic technology, using 35 high-frequency, oscillating Cinetic tips to accelerate the airflow to 180 mph and force out microscopic particles. This separates out and captures dust that would clog many other vacuums. Thanks to Dyson Ball technology, moving the vacuum around your home is a breeze. Steer it into hard-to-reach places easily, with accurate steering control and a 360 o articulated handle. The clever Cinetic Big Ball Animal 2+ also self-rights when toppled, so you can always expect a smooth cleaning experience without interruption. Versatile Cleaning Tools The Cinetic Big Ball Animal 2+ comes with five handy tools. These include a Stair Tool, Combination Tool, Carbon Fibre Turbinehead, Tangle-Free Turbine Tool and Reach Under Tool. The Tangle-Free Turbine Tool has counter-rotating heads with brushes to lift hair from your carpets and upholstery effortlessly. Convenient Features Reach every corner without having to change plugs thanks to the 6.7 metre cable and 3.16 metre stretch hose.

			"description": "Just as there are many causes of dry skin, there are many ways to combat it. The Dyson Humidifier For Dry Skin uses the latest ultraviolet cleanse technology to safely and hygienically hydrate the air in any room in which it is placed. It monitors the environment using intelligent climate control and is able to automatically maintain optimal temperature and humidity - at the touch of a button. Many people suffer from dry skin in the winter, when the air is cold and dry. In severe cases, it can crack the skin, severely dry out the sinuses, and create breathing problems. Humidifiers are not a new way to help deal with this problem. However, some humidifiers on the market gather bacteria in their water tanks; people in the room are then exposed to these bacteria as the mist is blown out - potentially leading to skin irritation or other health problems. The Dyson Humidifier For Dry Skin poses far less risk of this due to the ultraviolet cleanse technology that kills 99.9% of bacteria. While the technology can be harsh on commonly used household materials, this humidifier is made of military-grade plastic that is used in the construction of jet engines. It produces a fine and comfortable mist to hydrate air and is suitable for use in quite large rooms. It can be used safely in bedrooms all through the night and all year round, whatever the season. It hydrates air evenly and quietly. The Dyson Humidifier For Dry Skin can work hygienically alongside your existing dry skin treatments, helping to reduce flare ups due to the dry air.",

Powerful and quiet is very difficult to achieve in a conventional fan. The new Dyson Cool fans have been engineered to be quieter, use less energy yet generate powerful airflow.

			"description": "The perfect thing to have in your room all year round, able to keep you cool in the summer and hot in the winter. It can either be used to fill a whole room or you can activate personal mode for a concentrated long range airflow, all of this is possible thanks to Jet Focus control. Air Multiplier technology draws in the surrounding air and speeds it up, creating smooth, powerful air projection. The temperature of the room is constantly monitored, so a consistent temperature will be kept in your room rather than traditional heaters, which overheat and waste energy. The AM09 is also incredibly safe, with no visible heating elements and an automatic cut-off if the heater is tipped over. With a built in sleep timer and automatic cut-out combined with the intelligent temperature control make it an ideal product for the bedroom. The AM09 also has been awarded Quiet Mark accreditation for sound quality. OVERVIEW Type Fan heater Power 2000 W Colour White nickel FEATURES Speed settings 10 Timer Yes",

			"description": "This Dyson DC26 Multi Floor Cylinder is the smallest cylinder vacuum cleaner in the Dyson range. Weighing at only 5.3kg, this Dyson is easy to store and move around a house making this the perfect vacuum for all Dyson users. The lifetime HEPA filter ensures that not only is the DC26 easy to store but also no harm to the air inside the building. DC26 is designed for homes where storage is at a premium. It weighs just 5.3kg and fits on an A4 sheet of paper. But choosing a smaller machine doesn't have to mean sacrificing performance - DC26 works like a full-size Dyson vacuum cleaner. Root Cyclone technology Conventional vacuum cleaners rely on bags to trap dust and dirt. But when you start to use some bagged machines, dust can clog the tiny holes in the bag. Some ordinary bagless vacuum cleaners work in a similar way. They use a central filter to trap fine dust, which can clog too. Suction drops, leaving dust and dirt behind in your home. Dysons patented Root Cyclone technology doesnt rely on a bag to trap dust and dirt. Instead, it spins the air so fast that centrifugal forces up to 268,000 times the force of gravity fling dust and dirt out of the air and straight into the clear bin. And that includes the fine dust that can restrict airflow in some ordinary bagless vacuums. Unlike some other vacuum cleaners, Dyson machines don't lose suction. Easy carrying and storage DC26 machines are ultra-lightweight and small - for homes where storage is at a premium, or as a second machine for upstairs. They weigh just 5.3kg and fit on an A4 sheet of paper. But there's no compromise on performance. The cyclones in a DC26 machine work like the larger cyclones in a full- size Dyson vacuum. Lifetime HEPA filter Dyson cyclones are able to extract particles as small as 0.5 microns - including common household allergens such as pollen and mould. But theres also a HEPA filter as an extra precaution for people with asthma and allergies. It won't need replacing - just give it a wash according to the instructions that come with the machine. Hygienic and quick to empty Emptying the bin on a Dyson vacuum is quick and hygienic. Just press the button to release the dirt. The bin is clear, so you can see when it needs emptying - and how much dust, dirt and pet hair the machine has captured. Dyson vacuums were the first to have clear bins - despite market researchers insisting it was a bad idea. Now clear bins are everywhere (though not all are made from the same ABS polycarbonate as riot shields, like Dyson bins). Dual channel floor tool Two separate airflow channels direct suction power evenly for high pick-up across every floor type.",

It is also 10% more energy efficient compared to the AM02, by reducing the turbulence making it quieter it means less energy is required to move air through. A remote control is included, with 10 precise airflow settings and a sleep timer, which can be programmed to turn off after pre-set intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 9 hours. Perfect for use throughout the night-time. The remote control is curved and magnetized to store neatly on the machine.Plus it is safe and easy to clean as there are no awkward safety grilles or fast spinning blades.

Find out how the latest technology works to make this latest model even better!What's the biggest difference?The Dyson AM06's most noticeable change is the noise level, especially when it's running on maximum power. The fan's loop head has been redesigned to make it wider and thinner, which means it is 75% quieter than the original AM01 Air Multiplier.How does the reduced noise level benefit me?Because the Dyson AM06 runs far more quietly, it means you can now use it in a much wider range of places. The most obvious benefit is in a bedroom at night, as the reduced noise level combined with the new sleep timer means you can put it on, easily fall asleep without being disturbed by it running, and not worry about it running throughout the whole night.It is also great if you have guests round for dinner, or simply want to watch the TV without disruption on a wa",

			"description": "The Dyson V8 Animal cord-free vacuum is engineered for homes with pets. The direct-drive cleaner head delivers 150% more brush bar power than the Dyson V6 Animal cord-free vacuum sucking up pet hair and ground in-dirt across both carpets and hard floors. Powered by the Dyson digital motor V8, it generates even more suction than its predecessor. And with whole machine filtration, it captures pet allergens and expels cleaner air than the air you breathe. Thanks to a revolutionary, lightweight cord-free format, it also transforms for easy cleaning up high, and transforms to a handheld for cleaning the sofa, stairs, or in the car with an extra tool for removing pet hair from smaller spaces. New battery chemistry delivers up to 40 minutes of fade-free suction to clean even further, while a new hygienic bin ejector means theres no need to touch the dirt. - Direct-drive cleaner head cleans all floor types - Whole machine filtration captures allergens - Transforms to clean up high, down low and in between - Up to 40 minutes of fade-free suction (25 minutes with motorised head attached) - Max mode 7 minutes of higher suction for tougher tasks - Powerful suction generated by the Dyson digital motor V8 - Mini motorised tool for tougher tasks - New hygienic bin emptying I love my V8.

			"product_name": "Dyson Cinetic DC54 Animal Cylinder Vacuum Cleaner with 5 Year Manufacturer's Guarantee",
			"description": "54 of Dyson's smallest and most efficient cyclones generate powerful centrifugal forces to separate more microscopic particles than any other cyclone. The oscillating tips vibrate to prevent the cyclone aperture clogging. A pre-motor filter is not required and the post-motor filter requires no maintenance - so there's nothing to wash or replace. Because of the efficiency of Dyson CineticTM cyclone technology, no pre-motor filter is required and the post-motor filter requires no maintenance. So there's nothing to wash or replace. And with no bag, there are no extra costs. Conventional cylinder vacuums can be awkward - they can be heavy to pull, head the wrong way and collide with obstacles. Dyson BallTM vacuums are the only cylinder vacuums with a central steering mechanism. The pivot point is located near the centre of the machine, enabling it to make tighter turning circles and follow with greater control. Latest carbon fibre turbine head engineered for all floor types. Conductive carbon fibre brushes remove fine dust from hard floors, and stiff nylon brushes remove ground-in dirt from carpets. No need to turn the brush bar off when moving from one floor type to another. The Articulating hard floor tool has soft nylon bristles that gently remove dust and dirt from wood and other delicate floors. It pivots 180 and has an ultra-slim profile to reach into the awkward gaps between cupboards and units more easily. There are two bristle curtains: the first removes large debris, while the second seals the tool to prevent suction leaking. The Dyson Tangle-free turbine tool is the only turbine tool that doesn't tangle. There's no brush bar for hair to wrap around. It uses counter-rotating heads with brushes to remove hair and dirt from carpets and upholstery and releases it straight into the bin. What's in the box DC54 Animal vacuum Tangle-free Turbine tool Articulated hard floor tool Operation manual Quick start guide 5 year guarantee",

Like all Dyson bladeless fans, it uses Air Multiplier technology. AM06 is quiet and powerful - 75% quieter than Dyson's previous generation of fans. Dyson engineers have reduced turbulence and noise throughout the machine by channelling airflow more efficiently. Motor noise and vibration have been isolated and significantly reduced. AM06 now houses a Helmholtz cavity, designed to capture and dissipate noise from the motor - which has been calibrated to run slower whilst maintaining powerful airflow. An eccentrically aligned loop allows air to ensure with less turbulence, further reducing noise. Key features: Air MultiplierTM technology - air is accelerated through an annular aperture, drawing in surrounding air to project smooth, powerful, high-velocity airflow. Safe - no fast-spinning blades. Acoustic engineering - streamlined air channels for reduced airflow turbulence make AM08 35% quieter than AM03. Awarded the Quiet Mark by the Noise Abatement Society. Energy efficient - engineered to create powerful airflow using 15% less energy than AM03. Sleep timer - AM08 can be programmed to turn off after preset intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 9 hours. Remote control - 10 precise airflow settings. Curved and magnetised to store neatly on the machine. Oscillation control - to project air around the room. One touch for smoother oscillation. Easy height adjust and touch-tilt - pivots on its own centre of gravity, staying put without clamping. All Dyson machines are tested rigorously during development, so AM06 comes with a 2 year parts and labour guarantee.

			"description": "This affordable Hoover condenser dryer is equipped with the superb Heat Pump technology, which improves energy efficiency by a marked amount using a unique heating system. Heat Pump Power The DNHD813A2 is an efficiency king, sporting a superb A++ energy efficiency rating - a feat that is in no small part thanks to the Heat Pump technology implemented. While the main method of drying is the same as conventional condenser dryers, where no external ventilation is required to use the appliance, a Heat Pump dryer recirculates air around the system, heating it up to a required level before introducing it back into the drum. This process saves energy due to a gentler heating cycle and optimised circulation system. The Sensor Drying feature is a huge time-saver when drying tricky loads; the sensors monitor moisture of items during a cycle, continuing a chosen programme until the desired level of dryness has been met. There are 4 settings to select from, giving you plenty of control over how your laundry emerges. The drum itself has an 8kg capacity, enabling you to dry plenty of items per load, and has Reverse Action too, which helps to reduce tangling and creasing of items while drying. Helpful Hoover Dryer The DNHD813A2 has a number of features to make your life that little bit easier day-to-day. An intuitive control panel and display keep you well informed of the status of your cycle; a Time Remaining feature that will let you know exactly how long a programme has left. This works perfectly with the Delay Start Timer, which can be set for up to a 24 hour delay - the chosen programme will start automatically at the set time, making this a must-have feature for a busy home. To ensure that this Hoover condenser dryer continues to provide expertly dried laundry time after time, both an 'empty water' and 'filter care' indicator has been added to the fascia. These will alert you in the event of either a full water tank, which can promptly be emptied, or a dirty filter, which can be easily cleaned and reused. Benefits of the Hoover DNHD813A2 Condenser Dryer Incredible A++ energy efficiency rating for lower-cost performance Heat Pump technology delivers maximum efficiency drying Spacious 8kg capacity drum has Reverse Action to reduce tangling Delay Start and Time Remaining keeps you in control of drying times Perfect drying every time, thanks to Sensor Drying",

			"description": "DC40 Multi Floor is a lightweight Dyson Ball upright vacuum cleaner for every floor type. The machine's cleaner head has an active base plate, which self-adjusts automatically for optimal contact with all floor types. On hard floors the base plate lowers to create an efficient seal, and the brush bar lifts clear of the floor to protect delicate surfaces. On carpet the base plate rises and brush bar lowers for optimum bristle penetration - removing ground-in dirt and pet hair from different depths of carpet pile. And because the cleaner head adjusts automatically, there are no fiddly dials and you don't need to bend down to make adjustments. Dyson cyclones capture more dirt than any other cyclone. DC40 Multi Floor has Radial Root Cyclone technology with remodelled airflows to maximise suction power.",

It captures ultrafine particles from the air including pollen, bacteria and pet dander and its three impregnated graphite crystals capture more odours, domestic fumes and gases, such as formaldehyde. Designed for all year round purification and circulation. Whilst in the warmer summer months this Dyson Fan provides a powerful stream of purified airflow which can cool you down.

Like all Dyson bladeless fans, it uses Air Multiplier technology to draw in surrounding air, creating powerful air projection. Some fans are quiet but weak; others are powerful but noisy. AM07 is quiet and powerful - 60% quieter than Dyson's AM02. Dyson engineers have reduced turbulence and noise throughout the machine by channelling airflow more efficiently. Motor noise and vibration have been isolated and significantly reduced. AM07 now houses a Helmholtz cavity, designed to capture and dissipate noise from the motor - which has been calibrated to run slower whilst maintaining powerful airflow. An eccentrically aligned loop allows air to ensure with less turbulence, further reducing noise. There's also a remote control for precise airflow control, and a sleep timer - AM07 can be programmed to turn off after preset intervals, for ease of use throughout the night.

Brand New in Box with 2 Year Dyson Warranty Fast, even whole room heating in winter. High velocity air to cool in summer Dyson AM05 fan heater uses Air MultiplierTM technology for long-range heat projection - it provides direct heat throughout the room. When used as a cooling fan it has powerful airflow and high air velocity to cool you effectively. There are no visible heating elements or fast-spinning blades, and the unit switches off automatically if tipped over. Air MultiplierTM technology Air is drawn in at the base of the machine. It is accelerated through a 2.5mm aperture, which creates an annular jet of air that passes over an airfoil-shaped ramp, channelling its direction. Surrounding air is drawn into the airflow, amplifying it. This is called inducement and entrainment. Unlike with conventional fan heaters or fans, there are no chopping blades, so there's no buffeting. Airflow is smooth. Heat distribution Long-range heat projection so you feel direct heat throughout the room. Remote control AM05 comes with a remote control. It can be used to turn the machine on and off and to adjust oscillation, temperature and airflow power. It's curved and magnetized to store neatly on top of the machine.

Brand New in Box with 2 Year Dyson Warranty Fast, even whole room heating in winter. High velocity air to cool in summer Dyson AM05 fan heater uses Air MultiplierTM technology for long-range heat projection - it provides direct heat throughout the room. When used as a cooling fan it has powerful airflow and high air velocity to cool you effectively. There are no visible heating elements or fast-spinning blades, and the unit switches off automatically if tipped over. Air MultiplierTM technology Air is drawn in at the base of the machine. It is accelerated through a 2.5mm aperture, which creates an annular jet of air that passes over an airfoil-shaped ramp, channelling its direction. Surrounding air is drawn into the airflow, amplifying it. This is called inducement and entrainment. Unlike with conventional fan heaters or fans, there are no chopping blades, so there's no buffeting. Airflow is smooth. Heat distribution Long-range heat projection so you feel direct heat throughout the room. Remote control AM05 comes with a remote control. It can be used to turn the machine on and off and to adjust oscillation, temperature and airflow power. It's curved and magnetized to store neatly on top of the machine. Touch-tilt AM05 pivots on its own center of gravity, staying put without clamping. It tilts 10 from upright in",

			"description": "A complete re-think in the way hair dryers are designed, the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer will change your beauty routine forever. Enlisting the help of some of the world's top hair stylists and engineers, Dyson have created a product that is light-weight, efficient and easy to use, yet still delivers powerful drying and styling results every day. Powerful technology; Dyson has turned convention on its head and redesigned the hair dryer by putting the motor in the handle. This change has rebalanced the dryer's weight and shape, allowing you to dry your hair for longer without getting that pesky arm ache. The V9 motor also spins up to 110,000 times per minute at one inaudible frequency, making it faster, lighter and quieter than other motors. Heat regulation; A microprocessor measures and regulates air temperature 20 times every second, keeping the temperature under control, which helps prevent extreme heat damage to protect natural shine. Fast drying; With the Supersonic Hair Dryer, heat and power settings can be adjusted quickly, ensuring controlled, high velocity airflow. Magnetic attachments; Only the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer comes with magnetic attachments - so you can adjust quickly and easily. The Dyson diffuser disperses air evenly around your curls, helping to reduce frizz and improve definition. With the Dyson Styling concentrator, you can shape your hair one section at a time - without worrying about disturbing the rest. While the Dyson Smoothing nozzle dries hair gently using smooth, wide air. Cool to touch; With Heat Shield technology, the surfaces of the attachments stay cool. Even during closeup styling.",

			"description": "DysonAM09 WhiteDyson Hot and Cool Bladeless Fan TheDyson AM09is the latest bladeless hot and cool fan heater from Dyson that replaces the AM05. The AM09 usesAir Multipliertechnology for long-range heat projection and a smooth, uninterrupted airflow with no unpleasant buffeting of the air. The Dyson AM09 is also an excellent cooling fan with a powerful airflow and high air velocity to cool you effectively. There are no visible heating elements or fast-spinning blades making it child safe and if the unit is accidentally knocked over it switches off automatically. Select your target room temperature to the degree and the AM09 switches on and off to maintainit. The AM09 pivots on its own center of gravity, staying put without clamping. It tilts 10 from upright in both directions, so you can direct airflow where you want it, it also variableoscillation. So How Does it Work ? UsingAir Multipliertechnology Air is drawn in at the base of the machine. It is accelerated through a 2.5mm aperture, which creates an annular jet of air that passes over an airfoil-shaped ramp, channelling its direction. Surrounding air is drawn into the airflow, amplifying it. This is called inducement and entrainment. Unlike with conventional fan heaters or fans, there are no chopping blades, so there's no buffeting. Airflow is smooth. Focused & Diffussed Mode The AM09 has two jet settings, you can choose focused mode for long-range powerful airflow, or select diffused mode for wide projection to mix the surrounding air.In focused mode, warm air is accelerated through a 2.5mm aperture and over an airfoil shaped ramp which projects a powerful stream of warm or cool air towards the user.In diffused mode, a jet of air is released from a second aperture. As the two jets meet, entrainment guides the airflow over a 45 degree angle, releasing a wide stream of powerful airflow.

And the bigger the gap between the cleaner head and the floor, the more suction power is wasted. DC41i has a cleaner head that automatically self-adjusts when moving between floor types. It creates the optimal cleaner head contact for every floor type, reducing air leaks and retaining more suction power. DC41i turns on the spot. And with the latest BallTM technology, there is less clutter around the ball - its streamlined profile allows DC41i to steer easily into difficult places. Because essential components are housed within the ball, the machine has a low centre of gravity, increasing stability. The Oxford Gait Laboratory - a human movement research facility jointly funded by the University of Oxford and Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre - used a 3D motion capture system to compare Dyson BallTM vacuums to conventional wheeled uprights. The data demonstrated that Dyson BallTM vacuums manoeuvre more easily around obstacles and into difficult places.

			"description": "A complete re-think in the way hair dryers are designed, the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer will change your beauty routine forever. Enlisting the help of some of the world's top hair stylists and engineers, Dyson have created a product that is light-weight, efficient and easy to use, yet still delivers powerful drying and styling results every day. Powerful technology; Dyson has turned convention on its head and redesigned the hair dryer by putting the motor in the handle. This change has rebalanced the dryer's weight and shape, allowing you to dry your hair for longer without getting that pesky arm ache. The V9 motor also spins up to 110,000 times per minute at one inaudible frequency, making it faster, lighter and quieter than other motors. Heat regulation; A microprocessor measures and regulates air temperature 20 times every second, keeping the temperature under control, which helps prevent extreme heat damage to protect natural shine. Fast drying; With the Supersonic Hair Dryer, heat and power settings can be adjusted quickly, ensuring controlled, high velocity airflow. Magnetic attachments; Only the Dyson Supersonic hair dryer comes with magnetic attachments - so you can adjust quickly and easily. The Dyson diffuser disperses air evenly around your curls, helping to reduce frizz and improve definition. With the Dyson Styling concentrator, you can shape your hair one section at a time - without worrying about disturbing the rest. While the Dyson Smoothing nozzle dries hair gently using smooth, wide air. Cool to touch; With Heat Shield technology, the surfaces of the attachments stay cool. Even during closeup styling.",

			"product_name": "Hoover DNHD813A2 Dynamic Next Aquavision Tumble Dryer",
			"description": "Hoover DNHD813A2 Tumble Dryer This is a Dryer with a decent 8kg load laundry capacity. The appliance is White with a white water collection glass door (Aquavision) and a digital display. Overall it has a B rating for Energy Efficiency (not at all bad for a tumble dryer). It has Hoovers heat pump and sensor technology; HEAT PUMP TECHNOLOGY Dryers with Heat Pump technology use the same process as condenser dryers, using hot air to remove moisture from your clothes, but circulates the air multiple times, reheating it each circulation using the heating coil. Tumble Dryer using Heat Pump technology do not reach the same temperatures that other dryers might, which ensures more efficient performance and gentler drying of laundry. This typically comes at the cost of increased drying times over standard Tumble Dryer. Key Features & Benefits 8kg Load Glass Door Heat Pump Technology The innovative Heat Pump System avoids the dispersal of hot air and reduces energy consumption by 40% compared to an A class model. The thermo-dynamic system is much more efficient than a conventional drying machine allowing you to dry your garments at significantly lower temperatures which is ideal for protecting even the most delicate fabrics. AquaVision Reservoir. The sometimes awkward to carry water condenser drawer has been replaced by a new patented AquaVision water reservoir that has been cleverly integrated into the door of the tumble dryer. 4 Sensor Dry Programmes. Most people tend to overset the drying time when they select a drying time for a washed load. With Sensor Drying you only need to select the degree of dryness you require and the dryer then switches off automatically when this level of dryness has been reached. This means that your garments are protected for longer. Delicate Wool Finish Cycle. A cool, delicate cycle to protect your woollens when drying. 24hrs Delay Start. This option allows you to delay the start of the wash cycle up to 24 hours, enabling you to arrive home just in time for when the cycle finishes rather than leave the clothes damp inside the washer. It also enables you to take advantage of cheaper-rate electricity tariffs. Countdown Display. The Hoover Countdown display gives an at-a-glance indication of the time remaining on any wash cycle so you can manage your time more effectively. Countdown Display Timed Drying Options 180. Timed drying periods to suit your needs. Timed Drying Options 180 Relax Programme. Tumbling of laundry in cool air to refresh up clothes. Relax Programme Rapid 40 Programme Shirts Programme. A pre-set 60 minute shirts programme that is suitable for both cotton and synthetic fabrics. By simply selecting the fabric type the machine will automatically determine the optimum drying temperature. Drying time can also be shortened according to the individual requirements. Shirts Programme Mix & Dry Programme. This cycle allows you to dry both cottons and synthetics together at the same time. Mix & Dry Programme Highly Efficient Reverse Action. This prevents clothes from tangling during the drying cycle and will therefore help them dry more quickly. Highly Efficient Reverse Action Empty Water Indicator. Used on condenser models, this light lets you know when to empty the water container. Empty Water Indicator Filter Care Indicator. Lets you know when to clean the fluff filter. Not only is this good practice, it will save you time and electricity. Filter Care Indicator A++ Energy 8559. 5x61cm FEATURES Load Size: 8kg Sensor Dry System.

Slim and light As the Free Motion 14.4V weighs less than 3kg it's easy to use and manoeuvre around your home. Its slender design is great for easy storage even in the smallest of spaces. Folding handle If you want to store Free Motion in a small space, the handle can easily be folded to make it more compact. The folded height is just 64cm: suitable for a typical kitchen cupboard. Variable power Free Motion is designed with high and low power settings, along with a rotating brush bar so you can clean both hard floors and carpets. When you use the high power mode, the LED nozzle lights are automatically activated, helping you to clean dark areas such as under the bed.",

			"description": "Case is supplied whether titanium or pink one, subject to availability Helps you maintain shinier, healthier hair Maintaining consistent, controlled temperatures, the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer prevents irreversible damage to your hair. Since temperatures over 150 degrees can create micro pores, the hairdryer won't over-heat your hair as you dry, helping to maintain even surfaces for greater shine. Fast drying You'll have your hair dried in less time with an air volume of 41 litres per second. The Dyson Supersonic uses Air Multiplier technology and a powerful digital motor to focus air output so you can spend less time drying your hair and more time getting ready to go out or get to work. Acoustically tuned Since it's acoustically tuned, the hair dryer doesn't vibrate as much as standard models, so it sounds less abrasive and noisy for more pleasant drying. The Dyson Supersonic features a motor small enough to fit in its handle, so it's lighter and more comfortable to use. Smoothing nozzle and accessories Use the included smoothing nozzle to dry and style simultaneously. It delivers a gentle, low-force airflow to help you sculpt your hair to look the way you want it. Take advantage of other styling accessories to look your best, including a concentrator and diffuser. A non-slip mat and hang-up loop allow for easy storage when you're done.",

Velocity Evo uses multi-cyclonic dust separation technology for improved cleaning. Velocity evo is powered by lithium batteries, so there's no need to worry about tripping over a cord as you clean. The runtime of up to 45 minutes is enough to clean a typical sized home. Velocity evo is cordless yet has the convenient features of a traditional upright, such as a large bin which can be emptied easily and hygienically, without exposing your hands to the dirt. Velocity evo features a 2.5m stretch hose, removable handle, extension tube, long crevice tool and a 2-in-1 crevice tool / dusting brush that will help you to clean all over your home. Settings can be changed instantly as you move through your home: switch on the rotating brushbar when you need to deep clean your carpets, switch on the turbo boost whenever extra power is needed.",

			"description": "Helps you maintain shinier, healthier hair Maintaining consistent, controlled temperatures, the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer prevents irreversible damage to your hair. Since temperatures over 150 degrees can create micro pores, the hairdryer won't over-heat your hair as you dry, helping to maintain even surfaces for greater shine. Fast drying You'll have your hair dried in less time with an air volume of 41 litres per second. The Dyson Supersonic uses Air Multiplier technology and a powerful digital motor to focus air output so you can spend less time drying your hair and more time getting ready to go out or get to work. Acoustically tuned Since it's acoustically tuned, the hair dryer doesn't vibrate as much as standard models, so it sounds less abrasive and noisy for more pleasant drying. The Dyson Supersonic features a motor small enough to fit in its handle, so it's lighter and more comfortable to use. Smoothing nozzle and accessories Use the included smoothing nozzle to dry and style simultaneously. It delivers a gentle, low-force airflow to help you sculpt your hair to look the way you want it. Take advantage of other styling accessories to look your best, including a concentrator and diffuser. A non-slip mat and hang-up loop allow for easy storage when you're done.",

			"description": "Radial Root Cyclone Dyson's patented cyclone technology captures more dirt than any other cyclone. In Radial Root Cyclone technology remodelled airflows maximise suction power. Improved flow efficiency reduces turbulence and preserves air pressure, so more microscopic particles are extracted by the inner cyclones. These refinements help remove more dust, allergens and pet hair from the home. Ball technology All of the vacuum's key components are housed within the ball itself, including the electronics, the motor, the pre-motor filter and 6.5m of power cable. This creates a low centre of gravity and provides stability. Dyson BallTM canister vacuums have a central steering mechanism, so they follow accurately as you pull them along. Triggerhead floor tool No need to bend down and adjust when moving between floor types. A rotating brush bar deep cleans carpets push the trigger and it switches off to protect delicate rugs and hard floors.A pressure trigger is built into the Triggerhead tool's handle. When pulled, this trigger creates a drop in pressure, activating the air switch inside the floor tool and switching the brush bar on or off for different floor types. No wires, and no electronics.",

DC50 Animal also comes with the Tangle-free Turbine tool - the only turbine tool which doesn't tangle. Four key cleaner head technologies combine to give DC50 Animal Dyson s most advanced cleaner head technology yet. It has been engineered for increased dirt pick-up across all floors. The cleaner head adjusts automatically to different floor types, and the brush bar contains carbon fibre filaments for removing fine dust from hard floors. Like all Dyson vacuums, DC50 Animal has no bag, so there s no loss of suction. Instead, patented cyclone technology spins dust and dirt from the air. With 2 Tier Radial cyclones, DC50 Animal has 19 cyclones that work in parallel across two tiers to generate high centrifugal forces. More microscopic particles as small as 0.5 microns are captured from the airflow. Unlike ordinary upright vacuum cleaners, DC50 Animal rides on a ball. It turns on the spot, steering easily around furniture and into difficult places. DC50 Animal has Dyson s latest Ball technology.

			"description": "The Dyson Airblade V HU02 has taken the outstanding features of the original high performing AB08 and revolutionised it! It is now 35% quieter than the original Dyson V. The redesigned digital V4 motor has enabled smoother air control inside the unit, as well as a reduction in the amount of air being pulled through the unit at any one time, reducing noise from turbulence. This air is then pushed through a reduced slot size, which whilst minimising overall noise, maintains an airspeed of 430mph, despite the adjustments. Its sound level is 79dB(A) at 1m and sound pressure is 63dB at 2m in a semi-anechoic chamber. The sound quality is excellent and it is certainly the dryer with the best noise to performance ratio we have used.",

The practical accessories and the Cinetic-Technology make the DC52 a strong helper, which is furthermore ideally suitable for allergy-sufferers. Dysons Cinetic Technology This tecnology ensures that allergens disappear, releasing only pure air.The seal of approval of the British Allergy Foundation and of the Swiss Centre of Allergy, Skin and Asthma proves that the smallest dirt and dust particles are removed reliably. Bagless Dysons vacuum cleaners dont need any dust bags contrasting common vacuum cleaners that are often blocked by dust and soil and losing their suction power along the years. This fact ensures a constant high suction power. The missing bag furthermore enables to save costs and produce less waste for a long time. Dyson Ball-Technology The Dyson Ball-Technology ensures manoeuvrability and low noise when it is powered, since the technical components are hidden inside of the ball. The different editions have different accessories perfectly adapting their versatility to personal demands.",

			"description": "The Dyson Airblade V HU02 has taken the outstanding features of the original high performing AB08 and revolutionised it! It is now 35% quieter than the original Dyson V. The redesigned digital V4 motor has enabled smoother air control inside the unit, as well as a reduction in the amount of air being pulled through the unit at any one time, reducing noise from turbulence. This air is then pushed through a reduced slot size, which whilst minimising overall noise, maintains an airspeed of 430mph, despite the adjustments. Its sound level is 79dB(A) at 1m and sound pressure is 63dB at 2m in a semi-anechoic chamber. The sound quality is excellent and it is certainly the dryer with the best noise to performance ratio we have used.",

			"description": "Make easy work of collecting dust and dirt with this Dyson vacuum cleaner. Its a handheld model, so its perfect for cleaning those hard to reach spaces, and even looks great with its iron and moulded yellow finish. Innovative Technology The V6 Trigger has a powerful digital motor which allows the cleaning mechanisms to spin 110,000 times per minute. Meanwhile, the 2 tier radial cyclones produce a powerful airflow to capture the finest particles. So, you can be confident your home is clean as can be. Battery Life This Dyson cleaner is a cordless model for ease and flexibility simply charge it up, and youre good to go. It will give you plenty of time to clean your homes nooks and crannies. A full charge takes only 3.5 hours, and once its complete, you have a full 20 minutes of battery time available. The motorised tool gives you 17 minutes of cleaning time, or if you need a cleaning boost, use the maximum power option which gives you six minutes of extra powerful suction. Dyson has also developed the innovative trigger grip design, so you can get the most out of each run-time. This means that the vacuum only uses battery power while youre cleaning, and the instant release trigger saves the battery in-between cleaning tasks. And, this model has a re-engineered nickel manganese cobalt battery, which provides 1.5x more power than the Dyson DC34. Lightweight Design Its important for handheld vacuums to be lightweight and easy to use, which sums up the Dyson V6 Trigger perfectly. It wont cause any aches and pains while youre doing the chores, and the balanced weight distribution makes it effortless to manoeuvre. Reaching up high or delving down the sides of the sofa wont be a problem. It also comes with a crevice tool, to make it even easier to reach the trickier spots. Hygienic Bin and Conical Filter Once youre finished, you can empty the contents hygienically into the bin with the push of a button. If the conical filter gets clogged, then not to worry its lifetime washable and easy to access, so you dont need to worry about replacements.

			"description": "Case is supplied whether titanium or pink one, subject to availability Helps you maintain shinier, healthier hair Maintaining consistent, controlled temperatures, the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer prevents irreversible damage to your hair. Since temperatures over 150 degrees can create micro pores, the hairdryer won't over-heat your hair as you dry, helping to maintain even surfaces for greater shine. Fast drying You'll have your hair dried in less time with an air volume of 41 litres per second. The Dyson Supersonic uses Air Multiplier technology and a powerful digital motor to focus air output so you can spend less time drying your hair and more time getting ready to go out or get to work. Acoustically tuned Since it's acoustically tuned, the hair dryer doesn't vibrate as much as standard models, so it sounds less abrasive and noisy for more pleasant drying. The Dyson Supersonic features a motor small enough to fit in its handle, so it's lighter and more comfortable to use. Smoothing nozzle and accessories Use the included smoothing nozzle to dry and style simultaneously. It delivers a gentle, low-force airflow to help you sculpt your hair to look the way you want it. Take advantage of other styling accessories to look your best, including a concentrator and diffuser. A non-slip mat and hang-up loop allow for easy storage when you're done.",

			"description": "Clean your home from top to bottom and get rid of pesky pet hairs with the DC45 Animal Pro upright vacuum cleaner from Dyson. This handy appliance features a a long aluminium tube for those hard-to-reach zareas, and can be detached from the stick to be used as a handheld vacuum cleaner. Thanks to Root Cyclone technology, the DC45 is bagless and doesn't lose any suction power. Dust is collected in the 0.35-litre tank. And just one press of a button empties the tank quickly and hygienically, so you never need to get your hands dirty!The DC45 features a motorised brush with carbon fibre filaments, which is perfect for cleaning hardwood floors. There's also a nylon brush for rugs and carpets. The DC 45 functions on 22.2 V battery power for 20 minutes' operation. wice the suction of any other cordless vacuum in useWith the Dyson digital motor V2 and Root Cyclone technology, DC45 provides powerful suction.Digital motor technologyDyson cordless vacuums are powered by the Dyson digital motor. This power-dense motor uses digital pulse technology and a neodymium magnet to spin at up to 110,000 times a minute. Its small size means that the machines it powers can also be small, light and powerful. And because its only 85 mm in diameter, it can be positioned directly above the grip shifting the vacuums centre of gravity and making it easy to handle. There are other cordless vacuums that are bagless. But with inefficient cyclones, dust can pass through onto the filter, clogging it and causing suction loss.Dyson cordless vacuums use patented cyclone technology, just like Dyson corded machines. Powerful centrifugal forces spin dust and dirt out of the air and into the bin.Balanced for easy cleaning from floor to ceilingDC45 is easy to lift its centre of gravity is located towards the grip. Its engineered for cleaning up top, down below and in-between.Motorised cleaner head for carpets and hard floorsDC45s brush bar has nylon bristles that remove ground-in dirt from carpets as well as a row of anti-static carbon fibre filaments. These filaments prevent the build up of static charge that holds fine dust to hard floors.Conductive carbon fibre filamentsMany cordless vacuums dont have brush bars, and those that do only contain nylon bristles. While these loosen dirt from carpets, theyre not as effective on hard floors where fine dust can be left behind.The brush bars of Dyson cordless vacuums are different. They have a row of anti-static carbon fibre filaments, as well as nylon bristles. The filaments prevent the build-up of the static charge that holds the fine dust to the floor, allowing it to be sucked up into the vacuum.",

			"description": "Effective all year round Air Multiplier technology Bladeless design Oscillation control The Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool Fan Heater is the ideal appliance for achieving the ideal temperature in your home all year round, whether your room needs heating up or cooling down, this fan can do it. The Air Multiplier technology accelerates air through an annular aperture, creating a high-velocity jet of air. This passes over an airfoil-shaped ramp, channelling its direction and creating areas of low pressure behind and around the fan. The change in pressure forces surrounding air to be drawn into the airflow, resulting in a powerful stream of smooth air. The Jet focus control enables you to focus the air on a specific area while the diffused mode projects air over a wider area range, the oscillation control enables the airflow to be directed around the room at the touch of a button. AM09 uses an intelligent thermostat to maintain your target temperature. Once your room is at the set temperature, AM09 will switch itself off. It will then switch on and off intermittently to keep the room at your target temperature. The sleep timer enables you to programme the fan heater to turn off after pre-set intervals ranging from 15 minutes to 9 hours making it great for bedrooms and the bladeless design not only makes the fan safer but also easier to clean.",
